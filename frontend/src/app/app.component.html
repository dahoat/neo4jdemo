  <h2>Official Cypher Manual</h2>
  <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/" target="_blank">https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/</a>


  <h2>Simple MATCH queries</h2>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    For this part, you should load the Pokemon example data.
    <app-database-control button="pokemon"></app-database-control>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We will start by simply fetching all nodes in the database. Because there might be a lot of them, we limit the number of results.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (node) RETURN node LIMIT 25"></app-snippset>
    The <b>MATCH</b> keyword tells the database we want to fetch some data according to a certain pattern which is/are given afterwards.
    All elements matching parts of the pattern are stored in a variable if one is given, in our case it is called <b>node</b>.
    The last part of the query is the <b>RETURN</b> after which all variables we want in our result are specified, in our case only <b>node</b>.
    The optional <b>LIMIT</b> caps the results after the given number.
    Without this, our database would return us 916 elements for the Pokemon test dataset.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    If we only want a specific type of nodes, we can specify this by adding a label to the pattern.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (pokemon:Pokemon) RETURN pokemon LIMIT 25"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    To show the difference, we now query the types Pokemon can have.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (t:Type) RETURN t"></app-snippset>
    Because there are only 18, we can omit the <b>LIMIT</b>.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    In this example we combine the previous two queries by specifying two patterns.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon), (t:Type) RETURN p, t LIMIT 25"></app-snippset>
    We now limit the number of results again to 25.
    This query is a very bad example (and Neo4J Browser warns about this one), because we are actually building the Cartesian product of the two sets of results.
    According to Neo4J Browser, the number of records would be 16164. <br />
    A better query is to ask for a Pokemon and its adjacent type:
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon)-[:HAS_TYPE]-(t:Type) RETURN p, t LIMIT 25"></app-snippset>
    Here, the label <b>HAS_TYPE</b> is the label of an edge connecting a Pokemon with its type.
    And because we both of the variables returned, we can replace <b>p, t</b> with an asterisk.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon)-[:HAS_TYPE]-(t:Type) RETURN * LIMIT 25"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    Nodes and edges can also have multiple labels.
    For example there are normal Pokemon and legendary ones (which are unique).
    The latter ones have two labels and can be queried accordingly.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Legendary) RETURN p"></app-snippset>
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon:Legendary) RETURN p"></app-snippset>
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Legendary:Pokemon) RETURN p"></app-snippset>
    All three queries yield the same result.
  </div>

  <h2>Filtering with Properties</h2>
  So far, we only selected nodes based on the labels. Most of the time, we also want to filter based on the stored properties.

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We now want to find the most famous Pokemon.
    Please be aware that the string comparison is case sensitive and the name is given in lower case.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon) WHERE p.name = 'pikachu' RETURN p"></app-snippset>
    The filtering is like in SQL done with the <b>WHERE</b> part.
    Here, we access the property <b>name</b> and compare it against <b>'pikachu'</b>.
    Another possibilily is to include the name already in the pattern:
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon{name: 'pikachu'}) RETURN *"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We can also filter for an internal id
    <app-snippset copy="false" query="MATCH (n) WHERE id(n) = 42 RETURN n"></app-snippset>
    Please note that the id is not really predictable and this query might not yield a meaningful result.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We can also filter using all kinds of functions and combinations.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (n:Pokemon) WHERE n.name starts with 'pi' RETURN n"></app-snippset>
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (n:Pokemon) WHERE n.name starts with 'pi' or n.name = 'charizard' RETURN n"></app-snippset>
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (n:Pokemon) WHERE n.name starts with 'c' and n.pokedexId <= 150 RETURN n"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <h2>Filtering with Paths</h2>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We can also use the paths to enhance our filtering.
    For example, we want only fire Pokemon from the first generation (which means a pokedexId <= 150).
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon)-[:HAS_TYPE]-(:Type{name: 'fire'}) WHERE p.pokedexId <= 150 RETURN *"></app-snippset>
    Because we did not assign a variable to <b>:Type</b>, we could use <b>RETURN *</b> and only got the Pokemon.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    Also edges can have properties.
    Pokemon might have more than one type.
    We now query all Pokemon with fire as secondary type.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon)-[:HAS_TYPE{slot: 2}]-(t:Type) WHERE t.name = 'fire' RETURN *"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We can also check for the absence of a certain path.
    In the next example, we want all pokemon which cannot evolve further.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p:Pokemon) WHERE NOT (p)-[:EVOLVES_TO]->() RETURN p LIMIT 25"></app-snippset>
    The <b>()</b> here stands for an arbitrary node we do not restrict in any way and also do not store in a variable. <br />
    Please note that we used <b>-[]-></b> which is a directed edge instead of the <b>-[]-</b> we used earlier.
    All edges in Neo4J are directed and we can care about the direction or not.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    Path patterns can be arbitrary complex.
    To find all pokemon having only two evolution states, we can use this query:
    <app-snippset query="MATCH chain=(p1:Pokemon)-[:EVOLVES_TO]->(p2:Pokemon) WHERE NOT (p2)-[:EVOLVES_TO]->() RETURN chain"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    For Pokemon with three evolutionary levels, we can use an abbreviation:
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (p1:Pokemon)-[:EVOLVES_TO*3]->(p3:Pokemon) WHERE NOT (p3)-[:EVOLVES_TO]->() RETURN *"></app-snippset>
    Where we do not see the full path but only start end end.
    If we again store the paths in a variable, we get all three Pokemon.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH chain=(p1:Pokemon)-[:EVOLVES_TO*2]->(p3:Pokemon) WHERE NOT (p3)-[:EVOLVES_TO]->() RETURN *"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <h2>Path finding</h2>
  <div class="lecture-part">
    For this part, you should load the Sinnoh example map.
    <app-database-control button="sinnohMap"></app-database-control>
    Please note I did some simplifications to the map.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    First of all, let's have a look at the whole map.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH (n) WHERE n:City or n:Town or n:Lake RETURN n"></app-snippset>
    Another way of querying with labels.
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    We can now find paths from <b>Snowpoint City</b> to <b>Hearthome City</b>.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH p=(start:City{name:'Snowpoint City'})-[:ROUTE*]-(end:City{name:'Hearthome City'}) RETURN p"></app-snippset>
    And get the lengths of each route.
    <app-snippset query="MATCH p=(start:City{name:'Snowpoint City'})-[:ROUTE*]-(end:City{name:'Hearthome City'}) RETURN length(p)"></app-snippset>
    And also both
    <app-snippset query="MATCH p=(start:City{name:'Snowpoint City'})-[:ROUTE*]-(end:City{name:'Hearthome City'}) RETURN length(p), p"></app-snippset>
  </div>

  <div class="lecture-part">
    Neo4J also offers some interesting functions like <b>shortestPath()</b> which finds the shortest instance of an path in an (according to the documentation) efficient way.
    Neo4J Browser advices to use an upper limit here to avoid long execution times
    <app-snippset query="MATCH p=shortestPath((start:City{name:'Snowpoint City'})-[:ROUTE*..10]-(end:City{name:'Hearthome City'})) RETURN length(p), p"></app-snippset>
  </div>
